# Ender 4
So a while ago, I bought my first 3d printer: an ender 4. Back then, it was a great machine but as time passed, things started to break and did not print well. Thus I decided to fix it up a little bit with better boards and such.

I just wanted to show that this conversion is possible for the people that were and are in the same boat that I was and need some guidance if you are stuck.

I was still rocking the old frame with v rollers and the huge frame. I had tmc 2209 stepper motors for silent operation and sensorless homing.

- sensorless homing on x and y
- probe on z

## Klipper ##
I kinda got over the size of the printer and decided to make a new one with linear rails and such. I will upload more files as I go but I'm still tweaking a lot. Hopefully, I can get to an endgame soon.
